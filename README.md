### Setup

- Install Python (over 3.6): https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Install necessary libraries to rerun the notebooks:
  - `pip install pandas`
  - `pip install matplotlib`
  - `pip install seaborn`
  - `pip install notebook`
  - `pip install sklearn`
  - `pip install imbalanced-learn`
  - `pip install xgboost`
  - `pip install catboost`
  - `pip install lightgbm`
  
  After that, if some base components are not installed yet, `numpy` and `scipy` should then be installed by:
  - `pip install numpy`
  - `pip install scipy`

### Compile & Run
- Run Jupyter Notebook from the root of the directory of source code - Reference: [Running the Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)
- Open the notebooks you want to rerun and run the desired cells
- Some cells will require the other cells to be run first so my suggestion is to run cells sequentailly. Also, if there is something that does not follow the normal sequential run, it is always noted in the head comments of each cell or through text cell with prefix "Caution".
